This guide explains how to write an efficient Python program to check if a number is odd or even by encapsulating the logic within a function that returns `True` or `False`.

-----

## üí° Core Concepts to Know

Here are the most important concepts to understand for this task.

  * **Functions for Answering Questions**: Functions are perfect for encapsulating the logic for a single, clear question. Naming them like `is_even`, `is_prime`, or `is_palindrome` makes your code incredibly readable.

  * **Returning a Boolean Expression**: The line `return number % 2 == 0` is a concise, "Pythonic" way to write this logic. It's more direct than writing a longer `if-else` statement to return `True` or `False` manually.

  * **Modulo for Divisibility (`%`)**: Once again, the modulo operator (`%`) is the fundamental tool for any problem involving divisibility checks.

  * **Separation of Concerns**: This is a clear example of separating logic from user interaction. The `is_even` function knows nothing about `input` or `print`; it only knows how to check a number.

## üìù The Step-by-Step Approach

This explains the logic of defining and using the boolean-based `is_even` function.

1.  **Define the Function:** We start by defining our function with `def is_even(number):`. The name `is_even` is a good practice for functions that return `True` or `False`, as it makes the code read like a question. The `number` is the parameter that will receive the integer to check.

2.  **The Core Logic (Modulo Test):** The heart of the function is the expression `number % 2 == 0`.

      * `number % 2` calculates the remainder of the number when divided by 2.
      * `== 0` compares that remainder to zero.

3.  **The Boolean Comparison:** This entire expression, `number % 2 == 0`, is a **boolean expression**. It will automatically evaluate to `True` if the remainder is `0` (an even number) or `False` if the remainder is not `0` (an odd number).

4.  **Return the Result:** The function uses `return` to send back the `True` or `False` value generated by the expression. This is a very clean and efficient way to write the function.

5.  **Use the Function:** In the main part of the program, the function is called inside an `if` statement: `if is_even(user_num):`. Python runs the function, gets back either `True` or `False`, and uses that result to decide which block of code to execute.

## üíª The Final Code: Two Methods

### **Method 1: Calling the Function with a Pre-defined Number**

```python
# --- Function Definition ---
# This function accepts an integer and returns True if it's even, False otherwise.
def is_even(number):
    # The expression (number % 2 == 0) will be either True or False.
    # We can return its result directly.
    return number % 2 == 0

# --- Main Program ---
num1 = 42
num2 = 77

# Call the function for the first number
if is_even(num1):
    print(f"The number {num1} is even.")
else:
    print(f"The number {num1} is odd.")

# Call the function for the second number
if is_even(num2):
    print(f"The number {num2} is even.")
else:
    print(f"The number {num2} is odd.")
```

### **Method 2: Calling the Function with User Input**

```python
# The function definition is the same as above
def is_even(number):
    return number % 2 == 0

# --- Main Program ---
try:
    user_num = int(input("Enter a whole number to check: "))

    # Call the function directly in the if statement
    if is_even(user_num):
        print("The number is Even.")
    else:
        print("The number is Odd.")

except ValueError:
    print("Error: Please enter a valid whole number.")
```

  * **Example Run:**
    ```
    Enter a whole number to check: 1024
    The number is Even.
    ```
