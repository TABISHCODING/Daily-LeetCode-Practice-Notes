# üî¢ Python Program: Printing Numbers from 1 to n

This guide explains how to write a Python program that asks a user for a number (`n`) and then prints all the whole numbers from 1 up to and including `n`.

-----

## üí° Core Concepts to Know

Here are the most important concepts to understand for this task.

  * **Dynamic Ranges** ‚ÜîÔ∏è: The `range()` function is flexible. You can use variables as its arguments, like `range(start, n)`, which allows your loops to adapt based on user input or other calculations in your program.

  * **The `n + 1` Rule**: This is a critical pattern in Python. To create a loop that runs up to and **includes** a number `n`, you must always define the range's `stop` value as `n + 1`.

  * **User-Driven Iteration**: This program is a simple example of a powerful concept where the user's input directly controls the program's flow‚Äîin this case, how many times the loop runs.

  * **`for` Loops are for Known Counts**: A `for` loop with `range()` is the ideal choice when you know the exact number of times you need to loop (even if that number is determined by a variable like `n`).

## üìù The Step-by-Step Approach (for the `for` loop)

This explains the logic behind the user-input version.

1.  **Get the Upper Limit (Input):** First, the program needs to know where the sequence should end. It asks the user for this number (`n`) and gets it as a string.

2.  **Prepare the Limit (Conversion):** The input string is converted into an integer `n` using `int()`. The `try-except` block makes sure the user entered a valid whole number.

3.  **Generate the Dynamic Sequence (`range(1, n + 1)`):** This is the key adaptation. The `range()` function doesn't just work with fixed numbers; it works perfectly with variables.

      * To make the loop run up to and **include** the user's number `n`, we must set the stop value to `n + 1`.
      * If the user enters `7`, `range(1, 7 + 1)` becomes `range(1, 8)`, which generates the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

4.  **Execute the Loop:** The `for` loop iterates through the sequence generated by `range(1, n + 1)` and prints each `number` one by one until it reaches the end.

## üíª The Final Code: Two Methods

The `for` loop is still the best tool for this, but now the end of our `range` will be a variable.

### **Method 1: Using a `for` Loop (The Standard Way)**

```python
try:
    # Get the upper limit 'n' from the user and convert it to an integer
    n = int(input("Enter the number to count up to: "))

    print(f"\n--- Printing numbers from 1 to {n} ---")
    # To include 'n', the range must go to n + 1
    for number in range(1, n + 1):
        print(number)

except ValueError:
    print("Error: Please enter a valid whole number.")
```

### **Method 2: Using a `while` Loop (An Alternative)**

```python
try:
    # Get the upper limit 'n' from the user
    n = int(input("Enter the number to count up to: "))

    print(f"\n--- Printing numbers from 1 to {n} ---")
    counter = 1

    # The loop continues as long as the counter is less than or equal to n
    while counter <= n:
        print(counter)
        # Increment the counter
        counter += 1

except ValueError:
    print("Error: Please enter a valid whole number.")
```

### **Example Run for both methods:**

```
Enter the number to count up to: 7

--- Printing numbers from 1 to 7 ---
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
```
