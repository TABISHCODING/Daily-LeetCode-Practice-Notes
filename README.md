## 📘 Foundation Concepts Growth Plan

Your `Python full Concept.md` evolves **as you progress through patterns**.
Each time you encounter a **new technique, syntax, or concept** (like recursion depth, generators, decorators, or comprehension optimization), update that file.

**Example Growth Path:**

1. Basic Syntax → Loops → Functions
2. Lists & Dictionaries → Recursion → OOP Basics
3. Lambda & Map/Filter → Exception Handling → File I/O
4. Modules → Itertools → Advanced Recursion
5. DP memoization patterns → Functional techniques

This ensures your **fundamental understanding scales with your DSA skillset**.

## 🎯 Success Metrics

**Weekly Goals:**

* [ ] Learn 2–3 new patterns
* [ ] Solve 15–20 problems
* [ ] Update `Python full Concept.md` with new learnings
* [ ] Document each solution in `Pattern_wise_leet_code`

**Monthly Milestones:**

* ✅ Month 1: Foundation
* ✅ Month 2: Linear Structures
* ✅ Month 3: Trees & Graphs
* ✅ Month 4: Advanced Patterns
