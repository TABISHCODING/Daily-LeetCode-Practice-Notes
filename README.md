## 💡 Pattern Recognition Tips

### Quick Identification Framework

**Step 1:** Identify Data Structure
- Array/String → Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Binary Search
- Linked List → Fast & Slow Pointers, Reversal
- Tree → DFS, BFS
- Graph → DFS, BFS, Topological Sort, Union-Find
- Matrix → DFS, BFS, DP

**Step 2:** Look for Keywords
- "Sorted" → Binary Search
- "Contiguous" → Sliding Window
- "Cycle" → Fast & Slow Pointers
- "K elements" → Heap
- "All combinations" → Backtracking
- "Optimize" → Dynamic Programming

**Step 3:** Check Constraints
- Time O(log n) required → Binary Search
- Space O(1) required → Two Pointers
- Multiple queries → Prefix Sum
- Need all solutions → Backtracking
