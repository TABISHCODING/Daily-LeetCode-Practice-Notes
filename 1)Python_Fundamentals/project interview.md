You are **100% right to point this out**, and thank you — this helps me fix it properly.

👉 **The problem is: I gave two different sets of interview question categories that don’t match each other in numbering or grouping.**
👉 **You want ONE unified, consistent, clean, complete list** that contains:

* All the general questions (Project overview, backend, AI, security, deployment, DB, etc.)
* All the technical questions based on the **actual files you uploaded** (Phases 1–10)
* No duplicates
* No mismatched numbering
* No missing categories
* No incomplete sections

🔥 **So now I will create your FINAL MASTER LIST → the ONLY list you need for interviews.**
🔥 **It will combine both sets into one clean structure.**
🔥 **It will remove duplicates.**
🔥 **It will cover all important topics based on your code & documentation.**

---

# ⭐ **SECTION A — PROJECT & ARCHITECTURE (10 Questions)**

### 👉 Each question contains:

* **LONG Answer** (detailed, technical, impressive)
* **SHORT Answer (30 sec)** (for rapid-fire or when interviewer says “briefly”)

---

# ✅ **1. Explain your project end-to-end (architecture + flow).**

### **🔷 LONG ANSWER:**

My project, **ResumeDoctor.AI**, is an AI-powered resume and job-description analysis tool.
The end-to-end flow is:

1. **Frontend** — User uploads a resume (PDF/DOCX) and pastes the JD.
2. The frontend sends both using **multipart/form-data** through a fetch POST call.
3. **Flask backend** receives the data via

   * `request.files['resume']`
   * `request.form['job_description']`
4. The resume file goes into **extractor.py**, which:

   * Uses **pdfplumber** for PDFs
   * **python-docx** for DOCX
   * Returns clean extracted text
5. Both extracted resume text + JD text are sent to **ai_client.py**, which:

   * Builds a structured prompt
   * Calls **Gemini 1.5 Flash**
   * Forces strict JSON output
   * Validates response keys (score, matched skills, missing skills, suggestions)
6. The final structured result goes back to **/analyze** route.
7. Optionally, **db.py** saves analysis history into an Oracle DB.
8. Flask sends a final JSON response to the frontend UI showing:

   * Match score
   * Matched skills
   * Missing skills
   * Suggestions

Final architecture:
**Frontend → Flask → extractor.py → ai_client.py → db.py → Frontend UI**

---

### **🔹 SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

ResumeDoctor.AI takes a resume and JD, extracts the text, sends both to Gemini AI, and returns a match score with skills and suggestions. The frontend uploads using multipart/form-data, Flask validates inputs, extractor.py extracts text, ai_client.py calls Gemini and parses JSON, db.py optionally stores results, and the frontend displays the output.

---

---

# ✅ **2. Walk me through the complete request → response cycle.**

### **🔷 LONG ANSWER:**

1. User clicks “Analyze Resume.”
2. Frontend creates a **FormData** object containing the PDF/DOCX file + JD text.
3. Sends a POST request using fetch to `/analyze`.
4. Flask receives data:

   * `request.files['resume']`
   * `request.form['job_description']`
5. Backend validates:

   * File type
   * File size
   * JD content
6. extractor.py extracts text using pdfplumber/python-docx.
7. ai_client.py builds prompt, calls Gemini, enforces strict JSON, and parses output.
8. db.py optionally stores analysis history.
9. Flask returns structured JSON with score, matched/missing skills, suggestions.
10. Frontend displays results immediately.

---

### **🔹 SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

Frontend sends resume + JD using FormData, backend validates, extractor.py extracts text, ai_client.py calls Gemini and parses the JSON, db.py optionally stores it, and Flask returns match score and skills to the frontend.

---

---

# ✅ **3. What problem does ResumeDoctor.AI solve?**

### **🔷 LONG ANSWER:**

Most candidates apply with generic resumes that don’t match job descriptions.
ResumeDoctor.AI solves the problem by:

* Analyzing the resume against the JD
* Identifying matched skills
* Highlighting missing skills
* Providing improvement suggestions
* Giving a match score (0–100)

It helps users tailor resumes for ATS systems and hiring managers.

---

### **🔹 SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

It tells job seekers how well their resume matches a JD by generating a match score, identifying matched and missing skills, and suggesting improvements.

---

---

# ✅ **4. Why did you choose Flask instead of FastAPI or Django?**

### **🔷 LONG ANSWER:**

I chose Flask because it is:

* **Lightweight and minimal** — perfect for AI microservices
* **Easy to integrate with file upload + LLM APIs**
* **Low boilerplate** compared to Django
* **Flexible project structure** (extractor.py, ai_client.py, db.py)
* FastAPI is faster, but speed isn’t a bottleneck for this project
* Django is too heavyweight for a small backend service
* Flask has a huge ecosystem and easy deployment on Render

---

### **🔹 SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

Flask is lightweight, simple, flexible, and ideal for a small AI microservice. It made it easy to integrate file uploads, modular code, and Gemini API. FastAPI and Django were unnecessary for this scope.

---

---

# ✅ **5. Explain the full backend architecture of your project.**

### **🔷 LONG ANSWER:**

My backend is designed in **5 clean layers**:

1. **app.py — Routing Layer**
   Handles endpoints, validation, orchestration.

2. **extractor.py — File Processing Layer**
   Extracts text from PDF/DOCX, handles errors.

3. **ai_client.py — AI Integration Layer**
   Creates prompt, calls Gemini, enforces JSON structure, parses response.

4. **db.py — Database Layer** (Optional)
   Saves resume text, JD text, scores, and results in Oracle DB.

5. **utils — Helper Layer**
   Sanitization, JSON cleaning, error utilities.

This modular approach improves clarity, debugging, and scalability.

---

### **🔹 SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

The backend has five layers: app.py for routing, extractor.py for text extraction, ai_client.py for Gemini calls, db.py for saving results, and utils for helpers. This modular structure keeps the system clean, scalable, and easy to debug.

---

---

# ✅ **6. Why did you separate extractor.py, ai_client.py, db.py?**

### **🔷 LONG ANSWER:**

I separated them because of:

### ✔ **Single Responsibility Principle**

Each module handles one job:

* extractor → text extraction
* ai_client → AI communication
* db → storage

### ✔ **Better debugging**

If extraction breaks → extractor.py
If AI breaks → ai_client.py

### ✔ **Easier scaling**

AI integration can be swapped to OpenAI or Claude without touching extraction.

### ✔ **Cleaner code**

app.py stays small and readable.

---

### **🔹 SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

To follow the Single Responsibility Principle. Each module focuses on one task—extraction, AI call, or DB save. It keeps the code clean, debuggable, and easily scalable.

---

---

# ✅ **7. What challenges did you face while building this project?**

### **🔷 LONG ANSWER:**

1. **PDF extraction issues**

   * Some PDFs had no text layer
   * Scanned or corrupted files
   * Fixed using try/except and minimum text checks

2. **Strict JSON from Gemini**

   * Sometimes Gemini returned mixed markdown + text
   * I removed code fences and validated JSON before using it

3. **Deployment on Render**

   * Needed Gunicorn
   * Needed to read dynamic PORT
   * Fixed using render.yaml

4. **Security**

   * Malicious file uploads
   * Size limit issues
   * Sanitizing file names

---

### **🔹 SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

Main challenges were PDF extraction failures, enforcing strict JSON from Gemini, handling corrupted files, and deployment issues on Render. I solved these using modular error handling, JSON cleaning, and proper Gunicorn + PORT configuration.

---

---

# ✅ **8. How do you ensure your project handles files securely?**

### **🔷 LONG ANSWER:**

I implemented several security measures:

### ✔ File Type Validation

Only PDF and DOCX are allowed.

### ✔ File Size Limit

Set MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH = 5MB.

### ✔ Temporary Storage

Store files only in `/tmp`, not permanently.

### ✔ Sanitized Filenames

Reject suspicious names like "../../test.exe".

### ✔ Exception Handling

Handle corrupted, encrypted, or unreadable files.

### ✔ Minimum Extracted Text

Reject files with too little content to prevent garbage input.

---

### **🔹 SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

I validate file type, enforce size limits, use safe temporary storage, sanitize filenames, catch corrupted files, and enforce minimum readable text. This prevents malicious uploads and insecure handling.

---

---

# ✅ **9. How does your match score logic work?**

### **🔷 LONG ANSWER:**

Match score is fully AI-driven.
Gemini receives both texts and the prompt instructs it to:

* Identify matched technical skills
* Identify missing technical skills
* Detect soft skills
* Provide actionable suggestions
* Generate a score from 0–100

I validate the JSON to ensure score is numeric and within 0–100.
The model considers:

* Skill overlap
* Relevance to role
* Keyword density
* Overall content alignment

---

### **🔹 SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

Gemini analyzes resume + JD and returns structured JSON with matched skills, missing skills, and a score from 0–100. The score is based on skill overlap and role relevance. I validate the JSON and ensure the score stays within range.

---

---

# ✅ **10. What improvements will you add in the next version?**

### **🔷 LONG ANSWER:**

Upcoming improvements:

1. **OCR for scanned PDFs**
2. **User accounts + analysis history**
3. **Semantic matching using vector DB (FAISS)**
4. **Multi-resume comparison**
5. **Better scoring logic with weightage**
6. **Frontend visualizations for skill gaps**
7. **Caching AI responses to reduce API cost**

---

### **🔹 SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

I plan to add OCR support, user accounts with history, vector-based semantic matching, multi-resume comparison, better scoring logic, visual dashboards, and caching to reduce AI cost.

# ⭐ **SECTION B — FILE UPLOAD + EXTRACTION (8 Questions)**

### 👉 Each question includes:

* **LONG Answer (detailed, technical)**
* **SHORT Answer (30 sec)**

---

# ✅ **11. How do you upload files in Flask?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

In my project, file upload is handled through Flask’s built-in support for multipart form data.
On the frontend, I send the resume using a **FormData** object and a POST request.

On the backend:

```python
resume_file = request.files.get('resume')
```

Flask automatically wraps uploaded files into a **FileStorage** object.

Steps:

1. The user selects a PDF/DOCX.
2. The frontend sends it with FormData using `fetch()`.
3. Flask retrieves it from `request.files`.
4. I validate type + size.
5. I pass the file stream to **extractor.py** for text extraction.

No file is permanently saved — everything works in memory.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

I upload files in Flask using `request.files`, which stores the uploaded PDF/DOCX as a FileStorage object. The frontend sends it using FormData, Flask receives it via multipart/form-data, validates it, and passes it directly to extractor.py without saving it to disk.

---

---

# ✅ **12. Why multipart/form-data instead of JSON for file uploads?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

Files cannot be transmitted inside JSON because JSON only supports text-based data. PDF and DOCX are binary files.

`multipart/form-data` allows sending:

* Binary data (resume file)
* Text fields (JD)
* Metadata

It also allows the backend to extract files via `request.files` while regular form fields appear in `request.form`.

For this project, it enables:

* Passing file streams directly into pdfplumber/python-docx
* Efficient memory handling
* Avoiding base64-encoded bulky JSON payloads

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

JSON can’t carry binary files. `multipart/form-data` is made for uploading PDFs/DOCXs, allowing Flask to access the file through `request.files` while other fields go into `request.form`. It’s the correct and efficient format for file uploads.

---

---

# ✅ **13. What is FileStorage in Flask?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

`FileStorage` is Flask/Werkzeug’s object wrapper for uploaded files.

It provides:

* File stream access (`file.read()`)
* Filename
* Content type
* Functions like `.save()`

In my project:

* Flask converts the uploaded resume into a FileStorage instance.
* I pass its underlying byte stream directly to **BytesIO** and then to pdfplumber/python-docx.
* No manual file saving is required.

It essentially represents an uploaded file inside the request.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

FileStorage is Flask’s wrapper for uploaded files. It stores the file stream, filename, and content type. I read the stream directly from FileStorage and pass it to extractor.py without saving the file.

---

---

# ✅ **14. How does pdfplumber extract text from PDF?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

pdfplumber works by reading the PDF page-by-page and extracting embedded text layers.

My process:

```python
with pdfplumber.open(BytesIO(file_bytes)) as pdf:
    for page in pdf.pages:
        text += page.extract_text()
```

pdfplumber:

* Uses PDF’s internal text objects
* Extracts paragraphs, lines, and characters
* Ignores images unless OCR is added

It’s very accurate for text-based PDFs.

If a PDF doesn’t contain a text layer (scanned or image-only), pdfplumber returns `None` or empty text, which I handle in extractor.py with a minimum text length check.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

pdfplumber opens the PDF as a file-like object and extracts text from each page’s text layer. It works well for normal PDFs but not for scanned ones, so I handle empty extraction in my code.

---

---

# ✅ **15. How does python-docx extract text from DOCX?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

DOCX is actually a zipped XML structure.
python-docx reads this structure and extracts text from paragraph nodes.

In my extractor:

```python
doc = docx.Document(BytesIO(file_bytes))
text = "\n".join([p.text for p in doc.paragraphs if p.text.strip()])
```

It handles:

* Paragraphs
* Headings
* Inline runs

It skips empty paragraphs to avoid noise.
This produces clean text for the AI model.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

python-docx opens the DOCX file, reads its XML structure, and extracts text from paragraph elements. I combine all non-empty paragraphs to get clean resume text.

---

---

# ✅ **16. How do you handle corrupted / encrypted / scanned PDFs?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

I implemented several defensive checks:

### ✔ Corrupted PDFs

Wrapped pdfplumber inside try/except and raise custom extraction errors.

### ✔ Encrypted PDFs

pdfplumber throws an error → I catch it and return:
“Encrypted PDF not supported.”

### ✔ Scanned PDFs

These have **no text layer**, so extraction returns empty text.

I handle this by:

* Checking minimum text length
* If too short → return a clear error:
  “Scanned or image-based PDFs are not supported.”

This prevents garbage results going into Gemini.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

I catch exceptions for corrupted or encrypted PDFs, and I check if pdfplumber returns empty text. If the PDF is scanned or unreadable, I return a clean error message instead of sending junk to the AI.

---

---

# ✅ **17. Why use BytesIO instead of saving files to disk?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

I use BytesIO for multiple reasons:

### ✔ Security

No dangerous file is ever saved to the server.

### ✔ Performance

Reading from memory is faster than writing+reading from disk.

### ✔ Works on Render

Render's free tier has an ephemeral filesystem; saving files is unreliable.

### ✔ Cleaner architecture

extractor.py expects a file-like object; BytesIO wraps the bytes from FileStorage seamlessly.

### ✔ Scalable

Supports stateless design — important for cloud deployment.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

BytesIO lets me process files directly in memory without saving them. It’s safer, faster, stateless, and ideal for Render where the filesystem is temporary.

---

---

# ✅ **18. How do you validate file type & size before processing?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

I use multiple layers of validation:

### 1. **File Size Limit**

```python
app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 5 * 1024 * 1024  # 5MB
```

If exceeded, Flask automatically throws HTTP 413.

### 2. **File Extension Validation**

```python
allowed = {'pdf', 'docx'}
```

Reject files like `.exe`, `.jpg`, `.zip`.

### 3. **MIME Type Check**

I ensure uploaded file has a valid content-type.

### 4. **Minimum Text Validation**

If extracted text length < threshold → reject.

All this stops malicious files, junk uploads, or oversized files.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

I enforce a 5MB MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH, allow only PDF/DOCX extensions, check MIME type, and ensure minimum extracted text. These checks prevent invalid or dangerous uploads before extraction.

# ⭐ **SECTION C — FRONTEND → BACKEND FLOW (4 Questions)**

### Each question includes:

✔ **LONG Answer (technical & detailed)**
✔ **SHORT Answer (30-second version)**

---

# ✅ **19. What is FormData and how does it send files to backend?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

`FormData` is a JavaScript API used to send files and text fields to the backend using HTTP POST requests.

In my project, when the user uploads a PDF/DOCX and enters the JD:

```js
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("resume", file);
formData.append("job_description", jdText);
```

FormData sends data using **multipart/form-data**, which supports:

* Binary files (like PDFs)
* Text fields (JD)
* Metadata such as file name and content type

When the `fetch()` request is made:

```js
fetch('/analyze', { method: 'POST', body: formData });
```

The browser automatically:

* Sets the correct **Content-Type** header
* Splits the file + text into individual MIME parts
* Streams them efficiently to the backend

On the backend:

* `request.files['resume']` gives the uploaded file
* `request.form['job_description']` gives the JD text

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

FormData is a JS API that lets me send files + text in a single POST request using multipart/form-data. The resume goes into `request.files`, the JD goes into `request.form`, and Flask can process both easily.

---

---

# ✅ **20. Explain the raw multipart HTTP request structure your backend receives.**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

A multipart/form-data request has multiple “parts,” each separated by a boundary.
This structure allows the browser to send both binary and text data together.

The backend receives something like:

```
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----xyz

------xyz
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="resume"; filename="sample.pdf"
Content-Type: application/pdf

(binary PDF bytes)
------xyz
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="job_description"

Software Engineer role at XYZ...
------xyz--
```

Flask automatically parses this into:

* `request.files['resume']` → FileStorage object containing PDF bytes
* `request.form['job_description']` → Plain text field

This structure allows efficient upload of mixed content without base64 encoding or heavy payloads.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

The browser sends multiple MIME “parts” separated by a boundary. One part contains the resume file (binary), and another contains the JD text. Flask converts these into `request.files` and `request.form`.

---

---

# ✅ **21. How does the frontend handle JSON responses returned by backend?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

After `/analyze` finishes processing, Flask returns a JSON object containing:

* match_score
* technical skills matched
* missing skills
* suggestions
* status messages

The frontend handles it with:

```js
const response = await fetch('/analyze', { method: 'POST', body: formData });
const data = await response.json();
```

Once parsed:

* The match score is displayed
* Matched/missing skills are shown in UI cards
* Suggestions are listed in bullet points
* Errors are displayed if the backend sends `{ error: "..." }`

The frontend does NOT reload the page; it dynamically updates DOM elements.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

The frontend uses `response.json()` to parse the backend’s JSON. Then it updates UI elements like match score, matched skills, missing skills, and suggestions using the values returned by Flask.

---

---

# ✅ **22. Why do you return JSON instead of HTML?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

I return JSON because:

### ✔ My backend is an API

It is designed to be a service, not tied to a visual frontend.

### ✔ Frontend handles rendering

The frontend already knows how to display the results.

### ✔ JSON is easier for:

* Debugging
* Integration with future mobile apps
* Reuse of backend API
* Returning structured data to JavaScript

### ✔ Faster communication

Only the data travels, not full HTML pages.

### ✔ Clean separation of concerns

* Backend = logic + AI + processing
* Frontend = UI + presentation

This also makes the project more scalable.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

I return JSON because the backend is an API. JSON is lightweight, easy to parse in JavaScript, reusable for future clients, and keeps frontend and backend responsibilities separate.

# ⭐ **SECTION D — GEMINI AI INTEGRATION (10 Questions)**

### Each includes:

✔ Long Answer (technical, architecture-level)
✔ 30-second Short Answer

---

# ✅ **23. How do you call the Gemini API in your backend?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

I created a dedicated module **ai_client.py** to communicate with Gemini.
Inside this file:

1. I load the API key from environment variables.
2. I initialize the Gemini client.
3. I build a structured prompt using resume_text and jd_text.
4. I call the API using the model `gemini-1.5-flash`:

```python
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-1.5-flash",
    contents=prompt
)
```

5. Gemini returns the output in a `candidates[0].content[0].text` field.
6. I pass that text to my JSON parser which extracts the JSON block.
7. Finally, the validated JSON is returned to `/analyze`.

The entire call is wrapped in try-except blocks to handle timeouts and API failures.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

I call Gemini inside ai_client.py by building a structured prompt and using the model `gemini-1.5-flash`. I read the API key from environment variables, make the request, extract the text response, and pass it through my JSON parser.

---

---

# ✅ **24. Explain your prompt engineering strategy.**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

My goal was to ensure **consistent, structured output**.
So my prompt includes:

1. **Clear instructions** — analyze resume + JD.
2. **Strict JSON schema** — match_score, matched skills, missing skills, suggestions.
3. **No extra text** — I tell the model “return ONLY JSON.”
4. **Format enforcement** — I provide an exact JSON example.
5. **Context size management** — I summarize long resume text before sending.
6. **Skill extraction logic** — instruct the model to match only REAL skills, not adjectives.

This reduces hallucination and ensures reliable structured output.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

I give Gemini a strict JSON schema, clear instructions, and an exact output example. I explicitly tell it to return “ONLY JSON.” This ensures consistent match_score, matched skills, missing skills, and suggestions every time.

---

---

# ✅ **25. How do you force Gemini to return STRICT JSON only?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

I enforce strict JSON using multiple techniques:

1. Provide a **JSON schema** in the prompt.
2. Add the instruction:
   **“Return ONLY JSON. No explanation or surrounding text.”**
3. Include an **example JSON output** so the model mirrors the structure.
4. After receiving the response, I clean it by removing:

   * Markdown code fences
   * Extra text before/after JSON
5. Finally, validate using `json.loads()` inside try/except.

If the parsed JSON doesn’t match the expected keys, I throw an error.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

I give Gemini a strict JSON template in the prompt, tell it to return ONLY JSON, remove any markdown from the output, and use `json.loads()` to validate the final response.

---

---

# ✅ **26. How do you parse the AI response safely?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

The parsing pipeline in ai_client.py is:

1. Extract raw text from `response.candidates`.
2. Remove unwanted characters like `json` or code fences.
3. Find the first `{` and last `}` to isolate valid JSON.
4. Use `json.loads()` inside a try-catch.
5. Validate keys:

   * match_score
   * technical_matched
   * technical_missing
   * soft_matched
   * soft_missing
   * suggestions

If anything is missing or invalid, I raise an error and handle it gracefully in `/analyze`.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

I extract the raw text, strip markdown/code fences, isolate the JSON block, load it with `json.loads()`, and validate required keys. If parsing fails, I return a clean error to the user.

---

---

# ✅ **27. What happens if Gemini returns malformed JSON?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

If Gemini returns malformed JSON, I:

1. Try parsing it — if `json.loads()` fails:
2. I attempt to “repair” the JSON by cleaning:

   * Markdown
   * Trailing commas
   * Extra text
3. If JSON is still invalid:
4. I return a graceful error from the backend:
   **“AI returned invalid JSON. Please try again.”**
5. I do NOT break the entire application.
6. I also log the raw AI output to improve prompt design.

This prevents server crashes and gives the user a stable experience.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

If Gemini returns invalid JSON, I clean the text, try re-parsing, and if it still fails, I return a safe error message instead of crashing. The system always fails gracefully.

---

---

# ✅ **28. What keys do you validate in the AI result?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

I validate the presence and datatype of the following keys:

* `match_score` (must be number between 0–100)
* `technical_matched` (array)
* `technical_missing` (array)
* `soft_matched` (array)
* `soft_missing` (array)
* `suggestions` (array of strings)

I ensure:

* Lists are non-empty
* Score is numeric
* No invalid formats
* No hallucinated fields

If any are missing → I throw a “Malformed AI output” error.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

I validate match_score, matched/missing skills (both technical & soft), and suggestions. I ensure score is 0–100 and all fields exist and are valid lists.

---

---

# ✅ **29. Why must match_score be between 0–100?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

A 0–100 scale is:

* Intuitive
* Industry-standard for matching systems
* Works well for visual UI
* Easy for users to understand

From a technical view:

* Prevents Gemini from hallucinating unrealistic values like “120”
* Keeps scoring consistent across all analyses
* Helps in potential future statistical tracking or dashboards

I validate score bounds before returning it to the frontend.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

0–100 is the standard scoring range. It keeps results consistent and prevents Gemini from hallucinating invalid values. I enforce this limit before sending the response.

---

---

# ✅ **30. How do you avoid hallucinations in AI output?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

I prevent hallucinations by:

1. Giving a **strict JSON schema** with required keys.
2. Clearly defining what skills should be extracted.
3. Telling Gemini:

   * “Do not invent skills not present in resume.”
   * “Only extract verifiable skills.”
4. Providing a concrete example JSON.
5. Limiting prompt creativity—focusing on analysis.
6. Validating returned skills against resume text (keyword match).
7. Returning an error if AI output deviates.

These steps significantly reduce hallucinations.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

I use strict JSON schema, clear instructions not to invent skills, example outputs, and validate skills against the resume text. This minimizes hallucinations.

---

---

# ✅ **31. Why did you choose gemini-1.5-flash model?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

I chose **gemini-1.5-flash** because:

* It is very fast
* Very cheap compared to Pro models
* Has high-quality text understanding
* Handles long context (perfect for resumes + JDs)
* Ideal for real-time resume analysis
* Provides stable JSON responses
* Low latency improves user experience

Using the heavier 1.5-Pro model wasn’t necessary since Flash already produced reliable results for this use case.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

gemini-1.5-flash is fast, cheap, and good at long-context text analysis. It gives quick, accurate output and is perfect for real-time resume–JD matching.

---

---

# ✅ **32. How do you handle AI timeouts or API quota issues?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

I wrapped the AI call in a try-except block:

* If timeout occurs → I send a user-friendly message:
  **“AI is taking longer than expected. Please try again.”**
* If rate limit/quota issues occur → I show:
  **“AI quota limit reached. Try after some time.”**
* I also implemented:

  * Retry attempts for transient errors
  * Log the failure for debugging
  * Protect the frontend from breaking

This ensures the system stays reliable even when the AI service has issues.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

I wrap Gemini calls in try-except, handle timeouts and quota errors, retry if needed, and return clean error messages so the system doesn’t break.

---

# ⭐ **SECTION E — /analyze ENDPOINT & BACKEND LOGIC**

### (Questions 33–39)

---

# ✅ **33. Explain the /analyze endpoint flow step-by-step.**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

The `/analyze` endpoint is the main processing pipeline. The steps are:

1. **Receive Request**

   * Flask receives a POST request with `multipart/form-data`.
   * Resume file is in `request.files['resume']`.
   * JD text is in `request.form['job_description']`.

2. **Validate Inputs**

   * Check if file exists
   * Check file type (PDF/DOCX)
   * Check size limit via MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH
   * Check JD is not empty

3. **Extract Text**

   * Pass file bytes to extractor.py
   * Use pdfplumber/python-docx
   * Catch errors for scanned/corrupted PDFs

4. **Validate Extracted Text**

   * If text length < minimum threshold → return error

5. **Call Gemini**

   * ai_client.py builds structured prompt
   * Sends resume text + JD
   * Receives strict JSON output
   * Parses & validates the JSON

6. **Optional DB Save**

   * db.py stores match score + texts for history

7. **Return JSON Response**

   * JSON includes: match score, matched skills, missing skills, suggestions
   * Frontend displays results

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

/analyze receives the resume + JD, validates them, extracts text using extractor.py, calls Gemini through ai_client.py, parses and validates the AI output, optionally saves it to DB, and returns a JSON response with score and skill gaps.

---

---

# ✅ **34. What input validations do you perform before calling AI?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

I perform the following validations:

1. **File Exists** → If no file uploaded, return error
2. **File Type Check** → Only PDF/DOCX allowed
3. **File Size Check** → 5MB limit via MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH
4. **JD Text Validation** → Must not be empty
5. **Filename Sanitization** → Prevent directory traversal
6. **Minimum Extracted Text Length** → Prevent scanned PDFs
7. **MIME-Type Check** → Avoid spoofed extensions

Only after these validations pass do I call the AI.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

I check if the resume exists, validate file type and size, ensure JD is not empty, sanitize filenames, and validate that extracted text is long enough. Only then do I call Gemini.

---

---

# ✅ **35. Why use jsonify instead of json.dumps?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

I use `jsonify()` because:

1. It automatically sets the correct **Content-Type: application/json**
2. It handles Unicode safely
3. It formats the response as proper JSON
4. It works naturally with Flask’s Response object
5. It avoids common pitfalls like double-encoding JSON
6. It supports dict → JSON conversion seamlessly

Using `json.dumps()` requires manually constructing a response and setting headers, which is unnecessary.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

jsonify automatically sets content-type, handles encoding, and returns a proper JSON response. json.dumps requires manual headers, so jsonify is cleaner and safer.

---

---

# ✅ **36. Why return 400 vs 413 vs 500?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

### ✔ **400 — Bad Request**

For user input errors:

* Missing file
* Unsupported file type
* Empty JD
* Invalid JSON from AI
* Corrupted file

### ✔ **413 — Payload Too Large**

Automatically raised by Flask if file size > MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH.

### ✔ **500 — Server Error**

Used only when something unexpected happens:

* AI server crash
* Internal code error
* Database failure

This distinction makes debugging easier and provides clearer feedback to users.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

400 is for user mistakes, 413 is for oversized files, and 500 is for unexpected server errors. Using correct status codes makes the API predictable and easy to debug.

---

---

# ✅ **37. Why strip JD text before using it?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

I use `jd_text.strip()` to:

1. Remove leading/trailing whitespace
2. Prevent empty-string cases like `"   "`
3. Reduce noise sent to the AI
4. Ensure consistent formatting in the prompt
5. Avoid accidental newlines breaking JSON or prompt structure

Clean input produces more reliable AI output.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

Stripping removes whitespace, prevents empty JD values, and ensures clean text for prompting. Clean input → better AI accuracy.

---

---

# ✅ **38. What happens if extracted text is too short?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

If pdfplumber or python-docx returns too short text (e.g., scanned PDFs), I check:

```python
if len(resume_text) < MIN_TEXT_LENGTH:
    return error("Resume text unreadable...")
```

Short text means:

* PDF is scanned
* PDF is image only
* DOCX has no meaningful text
* Extraction failed

Instead of sending garbage to Gemini (which causes hallucinations), I return a clean error message.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

If extracted text is too short, I return an error because scanned PDFs or corrupted docs cannot be analyzed. Sending unreadable text to AI causes bad results.

---

---

# ✅ **39. How do you handle exceptions globally inside /analyze?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

Inside `/analyze`, I wrap the entire pipeline in a **try-except** block:

```python
try:
    # full pipeline
except ExtractionError:
    return jsonify(error="Failed to extract text"), 400
except AIError:
    return jsonify(error="AI processing failed"), 500
except Exception as e:
    return jsonify(error="Internal server error"), 500
```

This ensures:

* No internal error crashes the server
* User receives clean error messages
* Logs capture the real stack trace
* The app stays stable under invalid inputs

Centralized error handling improves reliability.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

I wrap the whole pipeline in try/except and return clean JSON errors for extraction failures, AI issues, or unexpected exceptions. This keeps the API stable.

# ⭐ **SECTION F — DEPLOYMENT ON RENDER (6 Questions)**

### (Questions 40–45)

---

# ✅ **40. Explain your complete deployment process on Render.**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

My deployment process on Render:

1. **Push project to GitHub**
2. **Create a new Render Web Service**
3. Connect repository
4. Add **build command** (like installing dependencies)
5. Add **start command** using Gunicorn
6. Add **render.yaml** for auto-deployment
7. Add environment variables:

   * GEMINI_API_KEY
   * DB credentials
8. Render automatically:

   * Installs dependencies
   * Runs Gunicorn
   * Assigns a dynamic port
9. I update `app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=<env PORT>)`
10. Deploy and test the API

Render handles all CI/CD automatically.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

I deploy by connecting GitHub to Render, adding build/start commands in render.yaml, using Gunicorn, storing API keys in environment variables, and letting Render auto-build and assign a dynamic port.

---

---

# ✅ **41. Why use Gunicorn instead of Flask’s built-in server?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

Flask’s built-in server:

* Is for development only
* Single-threaded
* Not production safe
* No worker/process management

Gunicorn provides:

* Multiple workers
* High concurrency
* Better performance under load
* Proper HTTP handling
* Reliable production-grade WSGI server

Render requires a production server, so Gunicorn is the standard choice.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

Flask’s server is not made for production. Gunicorn is production-grade, supports multiple workers, handles load better, and is required by Render.

---

---

# ✅ **42. What is render.yaml and what does it configure?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

`render.yaml` is an infrastructure-as-code file that tells Render how to build and run my application.

It configures:

* Build command
* Start command
* Runtime environment
* Branch deploy settings
* Auto-deploy on Git push
* Environment variables
* Service type (web/background)

My file includes:

```yaml
buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
startCommand: gunicorn app:app
```

This automates deployments.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

render.yaml tells Render how to build and run the app. It defines build/start commands, environment variables, and auto-deploy settings.

---

---

# ✅ **43. How does Render assign PORT dynamically?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

Render does not allow hardcoding a port.
It assigns a **random port** every time the service boots.

Render then sets:

```
PORT=xxxxx
```

In the environment.
Your app MUST read PORT using:

```python
port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 5000))
```

If you don’t read PORT dynamically, Render cannot route traffic to your app.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

Render picks a random port each time and stores it in the PORT environment variable. Our Flask app must read this PORT or the service won't be reachable.

---

---

# ✅ **44. Why must your app read PORT from environment variables?**

### 🔷 LONG ANSWER:

Render’s load balancer only forwards traffic to the port it assigns, not to port 5000 or 8000.

So if you hardcode:

```python
app.run(port=5000)
```

Render cannot connect → service fails.

Instead:

```python
app.run(port=os.environ["PORT"])
```

This binds your app to the port Render chooses.

This is mandatory for cloud deployment.

---

### 🔹 SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):

Because Render uses a random port, and if you hardcode a port, your service will crash. Reading PORT from the environment makes the app compatible with Render’s routing.

---

---

# ✅ **45. How do you store API keys securely on Render?**

### 🔷 **LONG ANSWER:**

I store all secrets—including:

* GEMINI_API_KEY
* Oracle DB credentials
* Encryption keys

in **Render Environment Variables** section under “Environment → Secret Files / Variables.”

These are:

* Encrypted
* Not committed to GitHub
* Accessible only by my service
* Loaded via `os.environ` in Flask

Example:

```python
api_key = os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY")
```

This prevents exposure and keeps secrets secure.

---

### 🔹 **SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):**

I store API keys as Render environment variables so they are encrypted, not in GitHub, and securely accessed using `os.environ` inside the backend.

# ⭐ **G. SECURITY & SAFETY (3)**

---

## ✅ **46. How do you prevent SQL injection?**

### 🔷 LONG ANSWER:

In my project, I prevent SQL injection mainly by using **parameterized queries** with the Oracle driver (`cx_Oracle`) instead of string concatenation.

Example in `db.py`:

```python
cursor.execute("""
    INSERT INTO resume_analysis 
    (id, match_score, technical_matched, technical_missing,
     soft_matched, soft_missing, suggestions, resume_text, jd_text, created_at)
    VALUES (seq_analysis.nextval, :1, :2, :3, :4, :5, :6, :7, :8, SYSDATE)
""", (
    result['match_score'],
    json.dumps(result['technical_matched']),
    json.dumps(result['technical_missing']),
    json.dumps(result['soft_matched']),
    json.dumps(result['soft_missing']),
    json.dumps(result['suggestions']),
    resume_text,
    jd_text
))
```

Here:

* User input is **never** concatenated into the SQL string.
* Instead, values are passed as bind parameters (`:1`, `:2`, etc.).
* The database driver safely escapes and binds them.

On top of that:

* I **validate and sanitize text fields** before saving.
* I don’t execute dynamic SQL built from raw user input.

This combination makes SQL injection very difficult.

---

### 🔹 SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):

I use parameterized queries with cx_Oracle, never string concatenation. All user inputs are passed as bind variables, and I validate/sanitize text fields. This effectively prevents SQL injection.

---

## ✅ **47. How do you protect your Gemini API key?**

### 🔷 LONG ANSWER:

I protect the Gemini API key using these practices:

1. **Environment Variables (Render):**

   * I store `GEMINI_API_KEY` in Render’s environment variable settings.
   * It’s *not* hardcoded in the code or committed to GitHub.

2. **dotenv in Local Development:**

   * Locally, I keep it in a `.env` file (which is in `.gitignore`).
   * `load_dotenv()` loads it at runtime.

3. **Access in Code:**

   ```python
   import os
   GEMINI_API_KEY = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")
   ```

   * The key is only read at runtime, never printed or logged.

4. **No Exposure to Frontend:**

   * All Gemini calls happen on the backend.
   * The frontend never sees the key or touches the AI directly.

This ensures the key is encrypted and not leaked in the repository or browser.

---

### 🔹 SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):

I store the Gemini API key in Render environment variables (and in a local `.env` ignored by Git), read it with `os.getenv`, and never expose it on the frontend or commit it to GitHub.

## ✅ **48. How do you prevent malicious file uploads?**

### 🔷 LONG ANSWER:

I prevent malicious file uploads using several layers:

1. **Extension Whitelisting:**

   * Only allow `.pdf` and `.docx`.
   * Reject any file with other extensions.

2. **File Size Limit:**

   * `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH = 5 * 1024 * 1024` (5MB).
   * Flask auto-rejects larger payloads with 413.

3. **MIME Type & Basic Checks:**

   * Check `resume_file.content_type` for expected types.

4. **No Permanent Storage:**

   * Use in-memory streams (BytesIO) and `/tmp` if needed.
   * Files are not stored permanently on disk.

5. **Strict Parsing:**

   * Only pass files to pdfplumber/python-docx.
   * If parsing fails → treat file as unsafe and return error.

6. **Error Handling & Logging:**

   * Catch exceptions from extraction libraries.
   * Do not attempt to “execute” any uploaded content.

All these together significantly reduce risk from malicious uploads.

---

### 🔹 SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):

I whitelist PDF/DOCX, enforce a 5MB size limit, check MIME type, avoid permanent storage, and only process files through safe libraries like pdfplumber and python-docx. If extraction fails, I treat the file as unsafe and return an error.

# ⭐ **H. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS & SCALABILITY (3)**

---

## ✅ **49. How would you scale this system for 10k users?**

### 🔷 LONG ANSWER:

To scale for 10k users, I would focus on:

1. **Stateless Backend:**

   * My Flask app is already stateless (no session data stored on server).
   * This makes it easy to run multiple instances behind a load balancer.

2. **Horizontal Scaling:**

   * Increase the number of Gunicorn workers.
   * Run multiple app instances (containers/Render services) behind a load balancer.

3. **External File & Data Storage:**

   * Use object storage (like AWS S3) instead of local disk if we start storing resumes.
   * Use a managed database with proper indexing for analysis history.

4. **Caching & Throttling:**

   * Cache repeated AI results (same resume + JD) to reduce Gemini calls.
   * Apply rate limiting per user/IP to avoid abuse.

5. **Background Jobs for Heavy Tasks:**

   * Offload long-running AI calls or batch analyses to Celery/RQ workers.

6. **Monitoring & Logging:**

   * Add metrics (request latency, error rate, AI latency) using tools like Prometheus/Grafana or Render’s monitoring.

This would let the app handle high concurrency while keeping latency acceptable.

---

### 🔹 SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):

I would scale by keeping the backend stateless, running multiple Gunicorn/Flask instances behind a load balancer, using external storage (like S3 and a managed DB), caching repeated AI results, rate limiting users, and offloading heavy jobs to background workers.

## ✅ **50. How would you add OCR for scanned PDFs or asynchronous processing?**

### 🔷 LONG ANSWER:

**For OCR (scanned PDFs):**

1. Detect when pdfplumber returns little or no text.
2. In that case, pass the PDF pages to an OCR engine like **Tesseract** (via `pytesseract`) or a cloud OCR API.
3. Extract text from each page image.
4. Merge that text and send it to Gemini as usual.

**For Asynchronous Processing:**

1. Introduce a task queue, e.g., **Celery** with Redis or RQ.
2. When user uploads a resume, `/analyze` endpoint:

   * Quickly enqueues a background job with resume + JD.
   * Returns a job ID.
3. A worker process runs the heavy steps:

   * Extraction
   * OCR if needed
   * Gemini call
   * DB save
4. Frontend polls a `/status/<job_id>` endpoint or uses WebSockets to display result when ready.

This keeps the API responsive even for large files and slow AI calls.

---

### 🔹 SHORT ANSWER (30 sec):

For OCR, I’d detect when pdfplumber fails and then run pages through Tesseract or a cloud OCR API to get text. For async processing, I’d use Celery or RQ so `/analyze` just queues a job, and a background worker handles extraction + AI, while the frontend checks job status.

Here are **the 10 EXTRA questions** with **perfect fresher-level answers**, plus **their priorities** so you know what matters most in interviews.

These 10 answers will fully cover the remaining concepts from:

* Flask Basics
* Authentication
* Sessions
* Jinja2 templates
* `before_request`
* Route protection

---

# ⭐ PRIORITY ORDER (Most → Least Important)

### 🔥 **HIGH PRIORITY (must prepare perfectly)**

1. Registration flow
2. Login flow + session usage
3. Logout flow
4. Password hashing
5. Route protection (`before_request`)

### ⚡ MEDIUM PRIORITY

6. Jinja2 templates
7. Showing form errors
8. redirect() and url_for()

### 🌱 LOW PRIORITY (simple definitions)

9. Why hash passwords
10. Which hashing library used

---

# ⭐ EXTRA SECTION — AUTH & TEMPLATE QUESTIONS WITH ANSWERS

---

# **1. How does your registration flow work in ResumeDoctor.AI?**

⭐ **Priority: HIGH**

### ✅ Long Answer

My registration flow works as follows:

1. User opens the `/register` route where a Jinja form collects:

   * Name
   * Email
   * Password

2. Backend receives the form using `request.form`.

3. I validate fields:

   * Check for empty fields
   * Check if email already exists

4. I hash the password using Werkzeug or bcrypt **before saving** it to the database.

5. Insert user record into the DB (name, email, hashed password).

6. Redirect user to `/login` with a success message.

### ⏳ Short Answer

User submits the register form → backend validates → hashes password → saves user → redirects to login.

---

# **2. How does your login flow work? What do you store in session?**

⭐ **Priority: VERY HIGH (Most important)**

### ✅ Long Answer

1. User submits login form (email + password).
2. I fetch the user from the DB using the email.
3. I compare the hashed password using `check_password_hash()`.
4. If login is successful:

   * I store user identity inside Flask `session`:

     ```python
     session['user_id'] = user.id
     session['user_email'] = user.email
     ```
5. After login, user is redirected to the dashboard or main analyzer page.
6. If login fails, I show an error message using Jinja templates.

### ⏳ Short Answer

Validate user → check hashed password → on success store `user_id` in session → redirect to dashboard.

---

# **3. How do you implement logout? What happens in the backend?**

⭐ **Priority: HIGH**

### ✅ Long Answer

Logout simply clears the user session:

```python
session.clear()
return redirect(url_for('login'))
```

This removes:

* user_id
* user_email
* any stored auth state

The user is forced back to the login page.

### ⏳ Short Answer

I clear the session using `session.clear()` and redirect to the login page.

---

# **4. Why do you use password hashing instead of storing plain text passwords?**

⭐ **Priority: HIGH**

### 🎯 Perfect Answer

Storing plain text passwords is extremely insecure because:

* Database leaks expose real passwords
* Same password reused across multiple websites
* Attackers get full access instantly

Hashing converts the password into a **non-reversible** string.
Even if DB is leaked, attackers can’t recover the original password.

### ⏳ Short Answer

Hashing makes passwords non-reversible and keeps users safe even if the database is compromised.

---

# **5. Which hashing method/library did you use and how?**

⭐ **Priority: MEDIUM**

### Option A → Werkzeug (default Flask ecosystem)

```python
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash

hashed = generate_password_hash(password)
check_password_hash(hashed, input_password)
```

### Option B → bcrypt

More secure, slower (good for auth).

```python
import bcrypt
hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt())
```

### ⏳ Short Answer

I use `generate_password_hash()` to store passwords safely and `check_password_hash()` to verify during login.

---

# **6. What are Jinja2 templates and where did you use them?**

⭐ **Priority: MEDIUM**

### ✅ Long Answer

Jinja2 is Flask’s template engine.
It helps generate dynamic HTML using:

* Variables
* Loops
* Conditions

In my project I used Jinja2 for:

* Register page
* Login page
* Showing success/error messages
* Form validation messages

### ⏳ Short Answer

Jinja2 lets me generate dynamic HTML pages. I used it for login and register forms.

---

# **7. How do you show form errors (e.g., “invalid login”) in your HTML pages?**

⭐ **Priority: MEDIUM**

### Perfect Answer

I pass messages to the template using:

```python
return render_template("login.html", error="Invalid email or password")
```

In the template:

```html
{% if error %}
<p class="text-danger">{{ error }}</p>
{% endif %}
```

### ⏳ Short Answer

I pass an `error` variable to the template and display it conditionally using Jinja.

---

# **8. What is redirect() and url_for()? Where did you use them?**

⭐ **Priority: MEDIUM**

### redirect()

Redirects user to another route.

### url_for()

Generates URL dynamically using route name.

### Used in:

* After registration redirect → login
* After login redirect → dashboard
* Logout redirect → login

### ⏳ Short Answer

`redirect()` sends user to another page and `url_for()` builds URLs using route names. I used both for login/register navigation.

---

# **9. How do you use @app.before_request?**

⭐ **Priority: HIGH**

### Perfect Answer

`@app.before_request` runs **before every request**.
I use it for route protection:

```python
@app.before_request
def check_login():
    protected_routes = ['dashboard', 'analyze']
    if 'user_id' not in session and request.endpoint in protected_routes:
        return redirect(url_for('login'))
```

This ensures:

* Logged-out users cannot access analyzer/dashboard.
* Only authenticated users reach protected pages.

### ⏳ Short Answer

It runs before each request. I use it to check session and block unauthorized users.

---

# **10. How do you protect certain routes so only logged-in users can access them?**

⭐ **Priority: HIGH**

### Perfect Answer

Two methods:

### **Method 1 — Session Check**

```python
if 'user_id' not in session:
    return redirect(url_for('login'))
```

### **Method 2 — before_request Middleware**

Automatically protects all sensitive routes (best practice).

### Logic:

* If session does not contain user_id → redirect to login
* Otherwise → allow access

### ⏳ Short Answer

I protect routes by checking if `user_id` exists in session; if not, I redirect user to login.
