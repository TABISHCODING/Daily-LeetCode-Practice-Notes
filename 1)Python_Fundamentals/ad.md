Good morning/afternoon. My name is Md Tabish, and I am from Kolkata, West Bengal. I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Information Technology from the University of Engineering and Management.

Over the past year, I have focused on building a strong foundation in Python development and backend engineering. My technical experience includes developing backend services using Flask, building REST APIs, and working with Oracle SQL for table design, writing efficient queries, and integrating database operations with backend APIs.

As part of my learning journey, I built two major projects. The first is ResumeDoctor.AI, a resume–JD analysis system. It extracts keywords from resumes, compares them with job descriptions, and provides a match score along with improvement suggestions. I deployed this project on Render and handled the complete backend implementation.

My second project is an AI-Based Learning-to-Content Automation System, where I automated the process of converting long notes into short, ready-to-publish videos. I used Python along with external APIs for script generation, voice generation, image creation, and automated video assembly.

I also completed a Python backend internship at Labmentix, where I worked on API development, SQL tasks, debugging backend issues, and understanding real development workflows, which strengthened my practical problem-solving abilities.

Since my strongest foundation is in Python and databases, I chose the Python + Database + PySpark domain because it aligns naturally with my existing skills. I am currently building my PySpark fundamentals — especially working with DataFrames, transformations, joins, and simple ETL concepts — so I can contribute effectively to data-driven and scalable backend systems as well.

1. How to Ask for Feedback (Polite + Professional)

Ask this only at the end, not during the interview.

Option 1 — Safe & Professional

“Before we end, may I ask for a small feedback? I’d love to know if there’s anything I should improve for future interviews.”

Option 2 — Fresher-Friendly

“Since I’m in the learning phase, any quick feedback on my performance today would really help me grow. If it’s possible, I’d appreciate it.”

Option 3 — Very Polite (If interviewer looks strict)

“If it’s allowed, could you share one thing I did well and one thing I can improve?”

(This raises the chance they’ll share something.)

If the interviewer says: “We can’t give feedback.”

This is common. Companies avoid giving feedback because of policies.

Here is the exact script you should say:

✅ Perfect Response

“No problem at all. Thank you for letting me know. I appreciate your time today and I really enjoyed the discussion.”

This keeps your impression positive.

🟢 3. If you still want to leave a smart final impression

You can add this small line (optional):

“I’ll continue improving my skills. Thank you again for the opportunity.”

This shows maturity.
