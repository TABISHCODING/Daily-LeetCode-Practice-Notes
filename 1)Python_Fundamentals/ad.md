Good morning/afternoon. My name is Md Tabish, and I am from Kolkata, West Bengal. I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Information Technology from the University of Engineering and Management.

Over the past year, I have focused on building a strong foundation in Python development and backend engineering. My technical experience includes developing backend services using Flask, building REST APIs, and working with Oracle SQL for table design, writing efficient queries, and integrating database operations with backend APIs.

As part of my learning journey, I built two major projects. The first is ResumeDoctor.AI, a resume–JD analysis system. It extracts keywords from resumes, compares them with job descriptions, and provides a match score along with improvement suggestions. I deployed this project on Render and handled the complete backend implementation.

My second project is an AI-Based Learning-to-Content Automation System, where I automated the process of converting long notes into short, ready-to-publish videos. I used Python along with external APIs for script generation, voice generation, image creation, and automated video assembly.

I also completed a Python backend internship at Labmentix, where I worked on API development, SQL tasks, debugging backend issues, and understanding real development workflows, which strengthened my practical problem-solving abilities.

Since my strongest foundation is in Python and databases, I chose the Python + Database + PySpark domain because it aligns naturally with my existing skills. I am currently building my PySpark fundamentals — especially working with DataFrames, transformations, joins, and simple ETL concepts — so I can contribute effectively to data-driven and scalable backend systems as well.

 What were you doing after graduation?**

**Answer:**
I spent the time strengthening my fundamentals — Python, SQL, backend concepts, and building my own projects. As a fresher, this helped me improve my basics through consistent hands-on practice.
---







“Why didn’t you put PySpark in main skills?”

Use this perfect answer:

“I am currently building my PySpark fundamentals—mainly DataFrames, basic transformations, joins, and simple ETL logic.
I didn’t want to list it as a core skill until I complete a hands-on project.
But I’m comfortable with beginner-level concepts and actively improving.”

Safer, Shorter Version (use if they ask quickly):

“I built the full frontend myself using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and basic JS.
I used AI tools only to speed up template creation and get UI suggestions, but all the integration and customization was done by me.”




---

# ✅ **🔥 PERFECT ANSWER (Use this in interview)**

**“I selected the Python, Database, and PySpark domain because my strongest foundation is already in Python backend development using Flask and SQL.
Adding PySpark on top of this aligns naturally with what I already know.
Instead of shifting to completely different technologies like Java or React, I prefer to go deeper in Python-based backend and data engineering fundamentals.
This domain allows me to use my existing Python + SQL skills while learning PySpark for scalable data processing, which is highly relevant for modern backend systems.
So this choice gives me both confidence and growth.”**

**This is the BEST answer: it shows logic + honesty + future potential.**

---

---

# 🟩 **Short Answer (HR Friendly)**

**“I am strongest in Python and databases, and I want to build on existing skills. PySpark fits naturally with Python, so this domain aligns with my expertise and future career goals.”**

---

# 🟧 **Detailed Answer (Technical Panel)**

**“I already have solid hands-on experience in Python backend development using Flask and SQL databases. When I saw the domain options, Python + Database + PySpark was the most logical extension of my current skillset.
PySpark is widely used in scalable backend applications, ETL pipelines, and data processing systems, so learning it will help me become a more well-rounded backend developer.
Instead of picking domains like Java/React that require starting from scratch, I chose the domain where I can contribute quickly and grow efficiently.”**

---

# 🟥 **Strongest Answer (Face-to-face Round)**

Use this for *maximum impact*:

**“My goal is to become a strong backend engineer.
I already built projects using Flask, Python, and SQL, so selecting this domain helps me strengthen the backend track I have started.
PySpark is a great addition because modern backend systems handle large data, and PySpark is essential for distributed data pipelines.
This domain keeps my learning path aligned — Python backend + database + scalable data processing.
It feels natural and consistent rather than shifting to unrelated stacks like Java or React.”**

Modern companies—including Adobe—work heavily with data-driven and scalable systems.
Python gives me the flexibility to build backend logic, databases give me the foundation to structure and manage data correctly, and PySpark allows me to process large datasets efficiently.

This domain connects all three skills in a very natural way. It matches my existing strengths, aligns with my learning path, and supports the kind of career I want to grow into: a backend engineer who is also comfortable with data pipelines and distributed processing.”**

---

# 🎯 **Now Let's Prepare for Possible Follow-Up Questions**

### **1. “But you don’t have PySpark experience. Why choose it?”**

Answer:
**“Yes, I don’t have a PySpark project yet, but PySpark is built on Python, and its DataFrame syntax is similar to Pandas. I can pick it up quickly, and I have already started learning PySpark transformations, joins, and basic ETL tasks.”**

---

### **2. “Why didn’t you choose Java/React domain instead?”**

Answer:
**“Those domains require starting from zero.
Choosing the Python + DB + PySpark domain allows me to build on what I already know and become productive faster.”**

---

### **3. “Are you comfortable learning PySpark on the job?”**

Answer:
**“Absolutely. I have already started practicing DataFrames, joins, aggregations, and SQL queries in PySpark.
Since it extends Python, I can learn it quickly and contribute effectively.”**

---

### **4. “Do you want to be a backend developer or data engineer?”**

Safe answer:
**“My primary target is backend development, but I want to be flexible with data engineering tasks too. This domain gives me the chance to handle both API-level and data-level responsibilities.”**

---

# 🟨 **Extra Tip: Mention your Flask + DB Projects Smartly**

When they ask:

> “Why not choose Java/React domain?”

You say:
**“Because I have already built real backend systems in Python + Flask + SQL.
This domain allows me to keep improving instead of resetting my learning path.”**

---

# 🟦 **Final Ready-Made Answer (Use this EXACT intro in interview)**

**“I chose Python + Database + PySpark because I already have a strong foundation in Python backend using Flask and SQL.
This domain allows me to build on my strengths while learning PySpark for scalable data processing.
Instead of switching to completely different areas like Java or React, I wanted to stay aligned with backend technologies where I can contribute quickly and grow effectively.”**

---
Got it.
You are **Python + Database strong**, but **PySpark = ZERO knowledge**, and your interview domain includes PySpark.

So the interviewer will expect:

* **Basic** PySpark
* **Not deep big data engineering**
* **No real project**, just basic understanding
* **One small 10–15 line PySpark task**
* **Concept-level questions**

You only need → **Beginner + Interview-level PySpark**, not real big-data engineering.

Don’t worry — I’ll give you a **crash course + all expected questions + safe answers** for someone with *no PySpark project*.

---

# 🎯 **HOW TO ANSWER “Do you have PySpark project experience?”**

You should say:

> “I used PySpark at a learning level to understand DataFrames, transformations, joins, and simple ETL operations.
> I did not build a full project in PySpark, but I am comfortable with beginner-to-intermediate level operations.”

This is **safe and honest**, and interviewers accept this for apprenticeships.

Now, I will teach you ONLY what you need to CLEAR the interview.
