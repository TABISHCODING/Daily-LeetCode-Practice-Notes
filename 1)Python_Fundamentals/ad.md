Good morning/afternoon. My name is Md Tabish, and I am from Kolkata, West Bengal. I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Information Technology from the University of Engineering and Management.

Over the past year, I have focused on building a strong foundation in Python development and backend engineering. My technical experience includes developing backend services using Flask, building REST APIs, and working with Oracle SQL for table design, writing efficient queries, and integrating database operations with backend APIs.

As part of my learning journey, I built two major projects. The first is ResumeDoctor.AI, a resume–JD analysis system. It extracts keywords from resumes, compares them with job descriptions, and provides a match score along with improvement suggestions. I deployed this project on Render and handled the complete backend implementation.

My second project is an AI-Based Learning-to-Content Automation System, where I automated the process of converting long notes into short, ready-to-publish videos. I used Python along with external APIs for script generation, voice generation, image creation, and automated video assembly.

I also completed a Python backend internship at Labmentix, where I worked on API development, SQL tasks, debugging backend issues, and understanding real development workflows, which strengthened my practical problem-solving abilities.

Since my strongest foundation is in Python and databases, I chose the Python + Database + PySpark domain because it aligns naturally with my existing skills. I am currently building my PySpark fundamentals — especially working with DataFrames, transformations, joins, and simple ETL concepts — so I can contribute effectively to data-driven and scalable backend systems as well.

They will ask:

* Show me your tables.
* Why this column?
* Why this relationship?
* Why this index?

---

## **4. Real Problems you faced**

This reveals authenticity.

Examples:

* CORS errors
* Slow queries
* SQLAlchemy session issues
* Circular imports
* JWT expiration issues
* Deployment issues

---

## **5. Scaling Questions**

# ⭐ **MOST IMPORTANT AUTHENTICITY CHECK (THEY WILL DEFINITELY ASK THIS)**

> “Can you write a small Flask API here in the interview?”

Example request:

* Create a POST API for adding a user
* Validate input
* Save to DB
* Return success JSON

OR

> “Write an API that returns a list of students sorted by age.”

---

# ❗ **If you fail this, they know you copied the project.**

---

# 🔥 **SECTION 6 — ADVANCED QUESTIONS FOR ADOBE-LEVEL**

### **1. What is WSGI and why Flask needs it?**

Answer:
Flask is not a production server. WSGI connects Flask to servers like Gunicorn.

---

### **2. How to solve circular import issue in Flask?**

Answer:
Using **Blueprints**, or moving imports inside functions.

---

### **3. What is Flask's application context vs request context?**

* `g`, `current_app` → application context
* `request`, `session` → request context

---

### **4. What is thread-safety in Flask?**

Answer:
Flask uses a global object `request` which is thread-local, not shared across threads.

---

### **5. How do you handle file uploads in Flask?**

Using:

* `request.files`
* secure_filename()

---

### **6. What is a race condition?**

Example: two requests updating same record at the same time.

---

### **7. What is DB connection pooling?**

Used to reuse DB connections → improves performance.

---

### **8. Difference between synchronous and asynchronous Flask?**

Flask is not async by default.
