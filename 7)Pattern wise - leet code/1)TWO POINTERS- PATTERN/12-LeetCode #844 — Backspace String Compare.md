# 🧩 LeetCode 844 — Backspace String Compare

---

## 🧠 1️⃣ Problem Understanding (Simplified)

You are given two strings `s` and `t`, that may contain lowercase letters and the `#` symbol.

The `#` means a **backspace** — it deletes the character just before it (if there’s any).

Your task:
After applying all backspaces, determine whether the **two resulting strings are equal**.

---

### ⚙️ Example 1

**Input:**

```
s = "ab#c"
t = "ad#c"
```

**Output:** `True`

**Explanation:**

```
s → "a" "b" "#" "c" → "ac"
t → "a" "d" "#" "c" → "ac"
```

✅ Both become `"ac"` → **equal**

---

### ⚙️ Example 2

**Input:**

```
s = "a##c"
t = "#a#c"
```

**Output:** `True`

**Explanation:**

```
s: "a##c" → erase 'a' twice → "c"
t: "#a#c" → first '#' ignored, then erase 'a' → "c"
```

✅ Both become `"c"`

---

## 🧩 2️⃣ Approach 1 — Brute Force (Stack Simulation)

---

### 💡 Idea

We can simulate typing each string character by character, just like a text editor:

* Use a **stack (list)** to hold characters.
* For every character:

  * If it’s a **letter**, push it (append).
  * If it’s a **‘#’**, pop the last character (delete), but only if something exists.
* After finishing, the list contains the **final typed text**.
* Convert the list to a string using `"".join(stack)`.
* Compare results for `s` and `t`.

---

### 🧾 Code — Brute Force

```python
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        
        # Function to simulate typing
        def build(string):
            stack = []   # 1️⃣ Create a list to hold typed characters

            for ch in string:   # 2️⃣ Process each character
                if ch == '#':   # 3️⃣ If backspace:
                    if stack:   # ✅ Only delete if something exists
                        stack.pop()   # 4️⃣ Delete (undo last letter)
                else:
                    stack.append(ch)  # 5️⃣ Type a letter normally

            # 6️⃣ Combine all remaining characters into a final word
            return "".join(stack)
        
        # 7️⃣ Compare final results of s and t
        return build(s) == build(t)
```

## 🧱 Explanation — Line by Line

| Line | Code                          | Explanation                                                                                                           |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `stack = []`                  | Create an empty list to store characters as they are typed. This acts like your “screen.”                             |
| 2    | `for ch in string:`           | Loop through each character in the input string (`s` or `t`).                                                         |
| 3    | `if ch == '#':`               | Check if the current character is a backspace.                                                                        |
| 4    | `if stack:`                   | ✅ Safety check — only pop if the stack isn’t empty. Prevents an `IndexError` when `#` appears first or consecutively. |
| 5    | `stack.pop()`                 | Removes the **last typed character**, just like pressing backspace.                                                   |
| 6    | `else: stack.append(ch)`      | If it’s not `#`, type normally by pushing the character.                                                              |
| 7    | `return "".join(stack)`       | Join all the remaining characters into one final string (e.g. `['a','c'] → 'ac'`).                                    |
| 8    | `return build(s) == build(t)` | Build both strings separately and compare their final forms.                                                          |

---

## 🧠 Why `if stack:` is Needed

If the string starts with `#`, there’s nothing to delete.
So we must check before popping.

Example:

```
s = "##a#b"

# Step 1 → '#' → stack empty → do nothing
# Step 2 → '#' → stack still empty → do nothing
# Step 3 → 'a' → add → ['a']
# Step 4 → '#' → remove 'a' → []
# Step 5 → 'b' → add → ['b']
✅ Final → "b"
```

Without `if stack:`, step 1 would cause an **IndexError: pop from empty list**

---

## 🧠 Why `"".join(stack)` is Used

After all typing is done, `stack` looks like:

```
['a', 'c']
```

This is a list of characters, not a string.

To convert it into a final typed string:

```python
"".join(stack) → "ac"
```

* `""` means join without spaces.
* If you did `"*".join(stack)` you’d get `'a*c'`.

---

## 🧮 3️⃣ Dry Run — Step by Step

Let’s trace this **fully** for
`s = "ab#c"` and `t = "ad#c"`

---

### ▶️ Step 1: Process `s = "ab#c"`

| Step | Char | Stack Before | Action             | Stack After |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ | ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1    | 'a'  | []           | append('a')        | ['a']       |
| 2    | 'b'  | ['a']        | append('b')        | ['a', 'b']  |
| 3    | '#'  | ['a', 'b']   | pop() (remove 'b') | ['a']       |
| 4    | 'c'  | ['a']        | append('c')        | ['a', 'c']  |

✅ Final result → `"ac"`

---

### ▶️ Step 2: Process `t = "ad#c"`

| Step | Char | Stack Before | Action             | Stack After |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ | ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1    | 'a'  | []           | append('a')        | ['a']       |
| 2    | 'd'  | ['a']        | append('d')        | ['a', 'd']  |
| 3    | '#'  | ['a','d']    | pop() (remove 'd') | ['a']       |
| 4    | 'c'  | ['a']        | append('c')        | ['a', 'c']  |

✅ Final result → `"ac"`

---

### 🧾 Final Comparison

```python
return build(s) == build(t)
→ return "ac" == "ac"
→ True
```

✅ Both strings are equal.

---

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy

Think of `stack` as your text editor screen:

* Typing a letter → adds a character.
* Pressing backspace → removes the last letter if one exists.
* When done, your final typed text is the joined version of all characters left in the stack.

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

| Complexity          | Explanation                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⏱️ Time — O(n + m)  | Each character of both strings processed once.           |
| 💾 Space — O(n + m) | Each processed string stored in a separate list (stack). |

Excellent 👏 — this is exactly the right question to *truly understand* how the **two-pointer backspace algorithm** works “in parallel” for both strings `s` and `t`.

Let’s break down the **execution flow** of the code step by step — showing **how both sides move together**, how **each while-loop** interacts, and what’s happening *under the hood* as Python runs this line by line.

# 🧩 The Code (for reference)

        # These variables track how many characters need to be skipped
        # because of '#' backspaces in each string
        skip_s = skip_t = 0

        # Main loop: Continue until both strings have been fully processed
        while i >= 0 or j >= 0:

            # -------------------------------

# 🧠 How The Flow Works

At a high level:

* The **outer while loop** → controls both strings together (`while i >= 0 or j >= 0`).
* Inside that, two **inner while loops** → one for `s`, one for `t`.

  * Each one independently moves its pointer (`i` or `j`) **until** it lands on a “valid” character (not deleted).
* Then the code compares `s[i]` and `t[j]`.
* Then moves both pointers left again.

So, every **outer loop iteration** = “compare one character from s and one from t”.

---

# 🧩 Step-by-Step Parallel Execution

Let’s simulate it **line by line**, side-by-side:

### Input:

```
s = "ab#c"
t = "ad#c"
```

### Initial setup:

```
i = 3, j = 3
skip_s = 0, skip_t = 0
```

---

## 🔹 Outer While Loop — Iteration 1

✅ Condition: `i >= 0 or j >= 0` → (3 ≥ 0 or 3 ≥ 0) → **True**

### Step 1 — “Find next valid char in s”

We enter the **first inner while** (`while i >= 0:`):

| i | s[i] | skip_s | Action                           |
| - | ---- | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| 3 | 'c'  | 0      | Not ‘#’, skip_s = 0 → break loop |

✅ Stop: valid character `'c'` at index 3.

---

### Step 2 — “Find next valid char in t”

Now we go into the **second inner while** (`while j >= 0:`):

| j | t[j] | skip_t | Action                           |
| - | ---- | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| 3 | 'c'  | 0      | Not ‘#’, skip_t = 0 → break loop |

✅ Stop: valid character `'c'` at index 3.

---

### Step 3 — Compare Characters

| s[i] | t[j] | Result  |
| ---- | ---- | ------- |
| 'c'  | 'c'  | ✅ Equal |

✅ Continue

Then:

```
i -= 1 → 2
j -= 1 → 2
```

---

## 🔹 Outer While Loop — Iteration 2

✅ Condition: `i >= 0 or j >= 0` → (2 ≥ 0 or 2 ≥ 0) → **True**

### Step 1 — Process `s`

| i | s[i] | skip_s | Action                        |
| - | ---- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| 2 | '#'  | 0      | Found '#': skip_s = 1, i = 1  |
| 1 | 'b'  | 1      | skip_s > 0: skip_s = 0, i = 0 |
| 0 | 'a'  | 0      | Not '#', skip_s = 0 → break   |

✅ Now `s[i] = 'a'`

---

### Step 2 — Process `t`

| j | t[j] | skip_t | Action                        |
| - | ---- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| 2 | '#'  | 0      | Found '#': skip_t = 1, j = 1  |
| 1 | 'd'  | 1      | skip_t > 0: skip_t = 0, j = 0 |
| 0 | 'a'  | 0      | Not '#', skip_t = 0 → break   |

✅ Now `t[j] = 'a'`

---

### Step 3 — Compare Characters

| s[i] | t[j] | Result  |
| ---- | ---- | ------- |
| 'a'  | 'a'  | ✅ Equal |

✅ Continue

Then:

```
i -= 1 → -1
j -= 1 → -1
```

---

## 🔹 Outer While Loop — Iteration 3

Condition: `i >= 0 or j >= 0`
→ (-1 ≥ 0 or -1 ≥ 0)
→ ❌ False

Loop ends → return True ✅

| End     | -                    | -                    | -1 | -1 | -      | -      | ✅ True     |

# ⚙️ What Happens Internally (Execution Flow)

Let’s summarize how the CPU runs it conceptually:

1️⃣ **Enter outer while**
→ It checks both strings from the end.

2️⃣ **Run s’s inner while**
→ Moves pointer `i` left until a valid character (skipping backspaced ones).

3️⃣ **Run t’s inner while**
→ Moves pointer `j` left similarly.

4️⃣ **Now both pointers point to the current valid chars.**
→ Compare directly.

5️⃣ **Move both left** and repeat outer loop.

6️⃣ When both reach `-1` → stop and return `True`.

---

# 🧩 Think of It Like This (Analogy)

Imagine two people typing on separate screens:

* Each has a **cursor** at the end (`i`, `j`).
* They both type letters and hit backspace.
* You move both cursors backward together,
  skipping deleted letters.
* At each step, you look at what’s currently visible on both screens.
* If at any position letters differ → ❌ False.
* If both end up blank or same → ✅ True.

---

# ✅ Summary

| Step            | What Happens                                 | Example                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Outer `while`   | Runs while either string has characters left | `i >= 0 or j >= 0`      |
| Inner while (s) | Skips deleted chars in `s`                   | Handle `#` and `skip_s` |
| Inner while (t) | Skips deleted chars in `t`                   | Handle `#` and `skip_t` |
| Compare         | If both chars differ → return False          | Compare `s[i]`, `t[j]`  |
| Move pointers   | Go to previous chars                         | `i -= 1`, `j -= 1`      |
| Loop end        | Both reach `-1`                              | Return True ✅           |

---

In short:
💡 Both strings are processed *in parallel*,
each pointer independently skipping deleted characters,
but comparisons only happen **after both have valid letters**.
